# VisLies 2018 Gallery

October 23, 2018

What a great year for VisLies! We had a small room, but we packed it. And
you guys brought some great examples for us.

Let's take a look at all the great lies everyone told.

## Lake Macquarie Got Bigger

[Ben Simons] started with a quick geography lesson of Syndey, Australia. Not
that there is any specific lie about Syndey, but as a quick orientation for
us Northern-Hemisphere-ers that might not be familiar with it. The map is
shown here. As you can see, the coast has its fair share of bays and
rivers, but otherwise follows an arc.

So, [Ben][Ben Simons] was a bit surprised when he looked up to this TV
weather report and saw a rather startling change in the coastline.
According to this map, lake Macquarie (labeled near the weatherperson's
head) has become _huge_.

After a double take, it starts to become clear that, no, a huge chuck of
Australia has not broken off to sea. Yet. Probably. Rather, the colors used
to represent rainfall unwisely use the same color to represent ocean in
this map.

Rules of probability dictate that the area in this map between the Cessnock
and Lake Wacquarie labels has just received between 150 and 200mm of rain
(which is probably not enough to turn the whole area into a lake). But what
about the other patches? What about the other subtle features of the map?
Or are maybe we are supposed to assume that it's just really rainy off the
coast?
